# dotfiles

Clone this repo to `~/dotfiles` and run `./install.sh`. Files will be symlinked into `~` and old files will be backed up in `dotfiles.old`.

Install `fish` (on OS X run `brew install fish`) and `chsh -s fish`.

The `vimrc` uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). Don't forget to run `:PluginInstall`.
